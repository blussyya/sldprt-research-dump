## NQ-002A: Does `len = 2 * loopSize - 2` Hold Across The Full Archived Corpus?

**Status**: Answered

**Depends on**: EXP-004, EXP-009, EXP-011

**Answer**: This formula has been verified as INV-017 (Verified Structural Invariant). For every ONE-delimited section, `sectionBodyTokenCount = Block2[i] - 1`, which is equivalent to `len = 2 * loopSize - 3`. Verified across 8,763/8,763 sections (100%) across 8 files by EXP-013, with independent reproduction by EXP-016.

**Note on INV-012 equivalence**: The original INV-012 formula `len = 2 * loopSize - 2` was found to be incorrect (off by +1). The correct equivalent is `len = 2 * loopSize - 3`. See INV-012 correction note for details.

**Evidence archive**: `knowledge/evidence/2026-06-27_v0.4.0-invariant-validation.md`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-07-10_v0.4.2-stress-test.md`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-07-10_v0.4.2a-independent-parser.md`

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-001, OQ-001A, OQ-002, ASM-003.

## NQ-003: Are SMALL Tokens In GEAR Structurally Localized?

**Status**: Ready

**Depends on**: EXP-006

**If answered**: Determines whether SMALL values are a rare grammar production, a file/model-specific feature, or an artifact of the token threshold.

## NQ-009: Does Correcting The EXP-023/024 Block1->Block2 Offset Change Their Reported Results?

**Status**: Answered

**Depends on**: EXP-023, EXP-024, v0.4.4/FALSIFICATION_REVIEW.md, INV-005, EXP-018, EXP-021

**Answer**: Yes, substantially. The bug (EXP-023/024 read the Block1 header's constant first word, always `4`, and mislabeled it as the body length `N`, causing `block1Start + b1Word0*4` to always land on Block1's own body instead of Block2) was corrected using the already-established formula `block2Start = block1Start + (N+4)*4` with `N` read from `block1Start+12`. Results: (1) `secCount=0 for ALL 1,172 faces` is corrected -- at the right offset, Block2 header is valid for 1,172/1,172 faces and `secCount` matches an independent INV-009 cross-check 1,172/1,172. (2) `0 VALID candidates in EXP-024` is corrected -- 1,172/4,688 candidates are now VALID, exactly matching EXP-023's face count and resolving the previously unacknowledged contradiction between the two experiments. INV-016/017/018 all pass 100% under the corrected pipeline. (3) The `661/1,172 alternative-header correlation` is **unchanged** -- that detection logic never used the buggy offset. A new, exceptionless correlation was found between `secCount` and alternative-header presence/N-value (see OQ-018); this is recorded as an observation only, with no semantic meaning assigned.

**Evidence archive**: `v0.4.5/CORRECTION_NOTE.md`, `v0.4.5/SUMMARY.md`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-13_v0.4.5-EXP023-corrected.md`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-13_v0.4.5-EXP024-corrected.md`

## NQ-010: Is The secCount / Alternative-Header Correlation (OQ-018) Exceptionless?

**Status**: Answered

**Depends on**: NQ-009, EXP-023-CORRECTED (v0.4.5), OQ-018

**Answer**: Yes, on the tested corpus. EXP-026 (v0.4.6) independently re-derived the 1,172-face set using the v0.4.5-corrected Block1/Block2 offset formula (not the buggy v0.4.4 arithmetic) and hunted for counterexamples in four directions: secCount=1 without an N=1 alternative; secCount=2 without an N=2 alternative; secCount>=3 with any alternative; alternative N inconsistent with secCount. Result: 0 counterexamples in all four directions, across all 1,172 faces and each of the 7 files individually. The correlation is recorded as INV-019 (Status: Correlation, not a proven causal or structural law). Causal direction and semantic meaning remain explicitly unresolved. The alternative-header detection window (N∈{1,2} at fixed offsets mp-20/mp-24) was not extended, and HEADPHONE (62 faces) was not tested (not present in this repository checkout) — both noted as known gaps, not resolved by this experiment.

**Evidence archive**: `v0.4.6/SUMMARY.md`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-13_v0.4.6-EXP026.md`, `knowledge/KNOWN_INVARIANTS.md` INV-019.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-018 (causal-direction question narrowed, not closed).

**Evidence to archive**: Corrected extraction script, raw per-face JSON, counterexample counts by direction and by file. (Complete — see evidence archive above.)

## NQ-008: Can Normal-Gap Loop-Splitting Failure Be Reproduced And Archived?

**Status**: Deferred

**Depends on**: v0.3.0-v0.3.3 diagnostic scripts and representative files.

**If answered**: Strengthens FH-005 with raw evidence and exact corpus counts.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: Attempts to revive normal-discontinuity loop splitting without new evidence.

**Evidence to archive**: Diagnostic output showing false splits on strip diagonals, input files, face ids, threshold settings.

## NQ-013: What Is the Exact VC-Diameter Relationship for Cylindrical Surfaces?

**Status**: Answered (relationship NOT linear)

**Depends on**: EXP-027, EXP-028

**Answer**: EXP-028 FALSIFIED the linear scaling hypothesis. C04 (5mm) vc=70, C05 (3mm) vc=56. Ratio 70/56=1.25 ≠ diameter ratio 5/3=1.67. With only 2 data points, exact relationship cannot be determined. Need third diameter (e.g., 4mm) to fit power law vc = a * diameter^b.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-021 (hole geometry encoding). Linear scaling rejected.

**Evidence to archive**: `v0.4.7/EXP028_HOLE_DIAMETER.json`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-14_v0.4.7-EXP028.md`.

## NQ-014: Is the DisplayList Re-Serialized on Any Face Change?

**Status**: Answered (YES, re-serialized)

**Depends on**: EXP-027, EXP-028

**Answer**: EXP-028 confirmed that binary diffs are dominated by inter-face metadata (50-80%). Face start offsets shift globally when faces are added/modified. The entire DL is re-serialized, not just affected faces.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-022 (feature locality). Incremental parsing not possible.

**Evidence to archive**: `v0.4.7/EXP028_FEATURE_LOCALIZATION.json`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-14_v0.4.7-EXP028.md`.

## NQ-015: Do SLDPRT Vertices Correspond to Exact STEP/STL Vertices?

**Status**: Answered (NO, tessellated approximations)

**Depends on**: EXP-027, EXP-028

**Answer**: EXP-028 FALSIFIED exact correspondence. SLDPRT↔STEP exact matches: 3/24 (C00), 6/212 (C04), 4/60 (C03). Mean distance ~0.01mm. SLDPRT vertices are DisplayList tessellation, not exact B-rep vertices.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-023 (vertex semantics). Parser output cannot be directly compared to STEP geometry.

**Evidence to archive**: `v0.4.7/EXP028_VERTEX_CORRESPONDENCE.json`, `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-14_v0.4.7-EXP028.md`.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-021 (hole geometry encoding), provides exact vc prediction formula.

**Evidence to archive**: vc for 4mm hole, power law fit, R² value, residual analysis.

## NQ-027: Why Does Adding a New Face at an Edge Cause Global Token Changes?

**Status**: Ready

**Depends on**: EXP-036

**If answered**: Determines the mechanism by which adding a new face at an edge location causes token changes on unrelated faces. Identifies what property of the added face causes the token changes.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-036 (why fillet/chamfer produce global token changes), OQ-032 (global model state mechanism), OQ-033 (fillet/chamfer common property).

**Evidence to archive**: Comparison of C03/C09 (which add a new face) vs C04/C05/C10/C11 (which do not); analysis of the added face's properties; analysis of token change patterns.

**Last updated**: 2026-08-14

**AUDIT NOTE (2026-08-14, Archivist Audit) — confound analysis before running any follow-up experiment:**

This question's premise ("adding a new face at an edge correlates with global token-signature changes") is plausible but not yet cleanly isolated from several confounds present in the current corpus. Full detail in `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-14_archivist-audit-EXP027-036.md`.

1. **"Adds a face" is not the discriminator.** EXP-036's own "added" metric (0 for holes/shell) is a measurement artifact of an orientation-bucket-collision bug in `exp036_feature_class_differential.js` — holes and shell also add faces (C04: +1 cylindrical face; C10: +5 inner walls, per EXP-035), the script just fails to detect them. So all four feature types tested (fillet, chamfer, hole, shell) add at least one face; "adding a face" per se cannot be what separates the two groups.
2. **"At an edge" has not been directly measured.** No script in EXP-027–036 computes real topological adjacency (shared edges/vertices) between the new face and existing faces. EXP-033's `isAdjacentToModified()` uses a same-orientation-label heuristic that cannot detect true adjacency on this corpus (Finding A in the audit file) — its "FALSIFIED" adjacency conclusion should be treated as untested, not as ruling adjacency out. "Adding a face at an edge" is currently a plausible domain-informed inference (fillet/chamfer are CAD edge features by definition) rather than a measured discriminator.
3. **Single edge location tested.** C03 (fillet) and C09 (chamfer) both consistently change face index 2/3 (+X/+Y) — see EXP-033 §4.3. No evidence in the archive shows the fillet and chamfer were applied to *different* edges of the cube. If both were applied to the same edge, the corpus has tested one edge-feature location with two feature types, not multiple independent locations, and cannot distinguish "faces adjacent to *the* modified edge change" from "faces at index 2/3 change whenever any edge-type feature is applied, regardless of which edge."
4. **Confounded variables not yet separated**, per the task's own list: feature type (edge feature vs. cut/hole feature) is perfectly confounded with "adds a face touching a pre-existing edge" in this corpus, because SolidWorks has no edge-modifying feature that doesn't also add a face, and no non-edge feature in the corpus that adds a face touching a pre-existing edge. Face ordering/serialization order is not ruled out either (face index happens to be identical across all compared models, so index-based and adjacency-based explanations remain indistinguishable with the current data).

**Recommendation**: NQ-027 is a reasonable next research direction in principle, but should not be pursued via a repeat of EXP-036's methodology. See NQ-028 for the smallest experiment that would discriminate "location-specific/adjacency-based" from "feature-type/global-state-based" explanations. Do not promote H8 ("adding a new face at an edge") beyond Hypothesis status until that test (or an equivalent one) is run.

**UPDATE (2026-08-15, EXP-037/EXP-038)**: Confounds (2) and (3) above are resolved. (2) "At an edge" is now directly measured via real vertex/edge-sharing adjacency (`computeAdjacency()`, EXP-037/038) rather than inferred — confirmed true for both tested edges. (3) A second edge location was tested (EXP-038, using a real C12 model supplied by the user): the changed-face set relocated to track the new edge, ruling out the "always faces 2/3 regardless of edge" alternative. Confound (1) ("adds a face" is not the discriminator — all four feature types add a face) remains valid and untouched by EXP-037/038. Confound (4) (WHY adjacency/direct-modification triggers a token change, and whether "real adjacency" vs. "this face's own vertices were directly modified" can be separated) remains open — see `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-15_v0.4.7-EXP038.md` Section 7. NQ-027's core "why" question is therefore still open, but with two of its four original confounds removed and Hypothesis H8 upgraded from Hypothesis to Strong Evidence (not Verified) for the location/adjacency-based framing specifically.

## NQ-028: Does Fillet/Chamfer Applied to a Different Edge Move the Affected Faces? (Smallest Discriminating Test for NQ-027)

**Status**: **Answered 2026-08-15 (EXP-038)**, for the two edge locations tested. A real C12 model (1mm fillet, edge shared by -X/-Y, verified from its own STEP file) was supplied by the user and compared against C00/C03 using EXP-037's tooling (with a validated bounding-box-center correspondence refinement). Result: the Block1 token-changed face set relocated from {+X,+Y} (C03) to {-X,-Y} (C12) — exactly the two faces bordering the new fillet edge, matching each model's own real (vertex-computed) adjacency set, and structurally unmodified in both cases. Face index also changed ({2,3}→{0,1}). **Verdict: Strong Evidence for the location/adjacency-based explanation (a) below, and Hypothesis B / (b) as literally stated is falsified** — not Verified/invariant (n=2 edges; mechanism and the adjacency-vs-direct-modification confound remain open). See `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-15_v0.4.7-EXP038.md`. No further experiment was begun after EXP-038, per instruction.

Status history: Blocked — attempted 2026-08-14 (EXP-037), core question NOT answered at that time. The controlled-corpus SLDPRT files were absent from this repository/environment entirely, and the archived JSON corpus contained exactly one fillet model (C03) and one chamfer model (C09), both confirmed (independently, by face-index tables in EXP-033 §4.3 and by EXP-037's own vertex-based adjacency computation) to modify the same physical edge. A new model was required; see `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-14_v0.4.7-EXP037.md` §6 for the exact specification (base = C00, 1mm fillet or chamfer on the edge shared by -X/-Y, suggested name `C12_cube_fillet_1mm_edge2`) — this is exactly the model the user supplied for EXP-038. EXP-037 built and validated the analysis tooling this question needed (`v0.4.7/exp037_edge_location_and_adjacency.js`: real vertex/edge-sharing adjacency, centroid-distance face correspondence); EXP-038 reused it with one measured refinement (bounding-box center) required once tested against the real C12 file.

**Depends on**: EXP-033, EXP-036, EXP-037, EXP-038, and the confound analysis in NQ-027 above.

**Answer** (EXP-038, 2026-08-15): (a) **location/adjacency-based** is supported by the evidence: for both tested edges, the specific faces that change are exactly the ones topologically adjacent (real, vertex-computed adjacency, not orientation label) to the edge actually modified, and this relocates correctly when the edge moves. (b) **feature-type/global-state-based, as literally stated** ("the same faces, index 2/3 or +X/+Y, change... independent of which edge") is falsified: C12 changes indices {0,1} / orientations {-X,-Y}, not {2,3} / {+X,+Y}. This is Strong Evidence, not a Verified invariant — n=2 edges, both vertical, both on the same cube; the mechanism is unknown; and "real topological adjacency" vs. "this face's own vertices were directly, if minutely, modified by the trim" remain confounded for edge-type features in this corpus (both point to the identical face set by construction). See `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-15_v0.4.7-EXP038.md` Section 7 for the full anti-overclaim discussion.

**Historical text below retained for continuity (proposed method, written before EXP-038 executed it):**

**If answered**: Directly discriminates two competing explanations for the EXP-033/036 "global token change" effect: (a) **location/adjacency-based** — the specific faces that change are always the ones topologically adjacent to whichever edge was actually modified; vs. (b) **feature-type/global-state-based** — the same faces (index 2/3, +X/+Y) change whenever *any* edge-type feature (fillet/chamfer) is applied anywhere on the model, independent of which edge. The current corpus cannot distinguish these because only one edge (the one between +X and +Y) has ever been filleted/chamfered.

**Proposed method** (generation not executed by EXP-037 — analysis tooling built and validated there, 2026-08-14; model supplied by the user and executed as EXP-038, 2026-08-15): Generate one additional controlled model — the same C00 base cube with a 1mm fillet (or chamfer) applied to a *different* edge, e.g. the edge shared by -X and -Y (or by +X and -Y), rather than the +X/+Y edge used by C03/C09. Parse it with the validated pipeline (or, for consistency with EXP-037, extract full per-face vertex arrays the way `vertex_analysis.js` does), and run `v0.4.7/exp037_edge_location_and_adjacency.js`'s `analyzePair`/`computeAdjacency`/`matchFaces` against a new `C00_cube_10mm_vs_C12_...` pair to check which faces' Block1 token signatures change relative to C00, and whether the real (vertex-computed) adjacency set moves with the new edge.
- If the changed faces are now -X/-Y (i.e., track the new edge location) → supports the location/adjacency-based explanation. **This is what happened** — see Answer above.
- If the changed faces are still +X/+Y (i.e., independent of which edge was modified) → falsifies the adjacency-based explanation and supports a feature-type or global-serialization-counter explanation instead (e.g., "the first edge-type feature in the tree always perturbs faces 2/3" or a monotonically-incrementing internal ID unrelated to geometric location).

Either outcome is a clean falsification of one branch, making this the highest information-gain single experiment available for NQ-027. It requires generating exactly one new SLDPRT file (not currently in the archived corpus) — no new tooling.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: NQ-027, OQ-032, OQ-033, OQ-036. (See those entries for updates reflecting EXP-038's answer.)

**Evidence to archive**: New model's Block1 token signatures by orientation, side-by-side with C00/C03/C09; explicit statement of which edge was modified; face index/orientation table matching EXP-033 §4.3's format. **Archived**: `knowledge/evidence/2026-08-15_v0.4.7-EXP038.md`, `v0.4.7/EXP038_RESULTS.json`, `v0.4.7/EXP038_SUMMARY.md`.

## NQ-029: Is Adjacency-Without-Modification Ever Sufficient, and Can a Model Fully Isolate It From Direct Modification?

**Status**: Partially Answered (EXP-039); fully isolating the co-occurring case is Blocked (requires a new SolidWorks model, design-stage only)

**Depends on**: EXP-037, EXP-038, EXP-039

**Answer (partial, EXP-039, 2026-08-16)**: Using shell (C10) and hole (C04) as controls where real adjacency and direct vertex modification come apart (unlike fillet/chamfer/C12, where they always co-occur), adjacency to changed/added geometry WITHOUT the face's own vertices moving never causes a token change: 0/12 across fillet, chamfer, hole, and shell, extending EXP-037's single qualitative shell observation to a quantified, multi-feature-type result. This makes direct modification the parsimonious explanation for every case tested (11/11 modified faces changed token, 0 counterexamples).

**What remains unanswered**: the complementary cell — direct modification WITHOUT any adjacency to new/changed geometry — has zero examples in this corpus, and EXP-039 argues (topologically) that no feature which creates a new face by editing an existing face's boundary loop can produce one: gaining a shared boundary with a new face is itself a boundary change for the neighbor, so "adjacent to new face" and "directly modified" are coextensive for that class of feature by construction. Testing modification-in-total-isolation from adjacency would need a fundamentally different mechanism.

**Proposed model** (`C14`, design-stage only, NOT built, NOT verified against real SolidWorks behavior): same `C00_cube_10mm` base, with a Split Line (or equivalent projected-curve/sketch-split feature) bisecting the +Z face into two coplanar rectangular halves (e.g. a line at `x=0.005`, spanning `y=0` to `y=0.01`, projected onto +Z). Predicted (unverified) effect: adds one new internal edge and two new vertices to +Z, splitting it into two new faces, without moving any of +Z's four original corner vertices and without touching any of the four side walls' own vertices at all. If the four side walls remain token-unchanged despite each now bordering one of the two new half-faces instead of the single original +Z face, that extends EXP-039's finding to a case with zero vertex perturbation anywhere near the new boundary. If their tokens DO change, that is the first case where pure new-face adjacency (with provably zero modification) causes a change, overturning EXP-039's interpretation. See `knowledge/RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md` "Possible Future Directions" for the same spec.

**Will eliminate or constrain**: OQ-032, OQ-033, OQ-036, Current Unknown #5 in `RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md`.

**Evidence to archive**: C14's Block1 tokens for the four side walls, before/after comparison against C00, real vertex-coordinate identity check for the side walls (expect: 100% identical), real adjacency check between each side wall and the two new split-half faces (expect: newly adjacent, 0 shared vertices with old +Z beyond the unchanged corners).

**CORRECTION NOTE (2026-08-17, audit of EXP-037→EXP-040)**: The "0/12 ... 11/11" answer above needs two corrections. (1) "11/11" is wrong — `EXP039_DIRECT_MODIFICATION_NECESSITY.json` never computed it (its `rows` array excludes every directly-modified face by construction); recomputed directly from `EXP037_RESULTS.json`/`EXP038_RESULTS.json`, the real figure is **14/14 known cases (1 unknown)**. (2) More importantly for this question specifically: re-checking which faces make up the 12 "adjacent" cases against `EXP037_RESULTS.json`'s own `added[].adjacentToModelFaces` data shows every one of them is adjacent only to an already-*directly-modified* neighbor (hole's -X/-Y/+X/+Y are adjacent to the hole's own modified +Z/-Z, not to the new cylindrical face; shell's four "adjacent" faces are adjacent to the shell's own modified opening, not to any of the five new inner walls; fillet/chamfer's -X/-Y are adjacent to +Y/+Z/-Z, not to the new face). **None of the 12 cases actually test "adjacent to newly-created geometry without modification" — they test "adjacent to a directly-modified neighbor without modification," which is a different, weaker claim.** This means NQ-029's title question ("Is Adjacency-Without-Modification Ever Sufficient?") is not actually answered even partially by the existing corpus — the confound this question was meant to test around is universal across all four feature types tested here, not specific to edge-type features as EXP-038 originally scoped it. The `C14` proposal below is unaffected by this correction and remains the way to actually test the question — if anything, this correction strengthens the case for it, since no existing model in this corpus can substitute. Full derivation: `v0.4.7/EXP039_SUMMARY.md`'s matching correction note. No new experiment was run to produce this note.
