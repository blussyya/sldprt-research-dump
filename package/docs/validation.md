# Validation

What each reader is checked against, and the current numbers. Everything here is re-run by
`npm test` against the research corpus (see [test/README.md](../test/README.md)) unless a link to
an experiment says otherwise.

## The corpus

| set | files | what makes it useful |
|---|---|---|
| `test files new/SW2022` | 24 | Purpose-built, one feature per model, dimensions fixed in advance. Each ships `model.SLDPRT`, `model.step`, `model.STL`, `model.x_t`, `model.x_b`, and the build log records the face count and SolidWorks' own surface type for every face. |
| `test files new/SW2011` | 25 | The same models built in SolidWorks 2011 (legacy container), geometry-matched to the 2022 set. |
| `test files original` | 24 | Production parts (gear, sprocket, enclosures, an ornamental panel, an imported STEP body), the first controlled cubes C00–C12, and three pre-2011 parts (one of them an empty part with no solid). |

That is 73 SLDPRT files in all. The corpus is in the
[dump repository](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump), not this one.

## Display mesh

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Parse output equals the golden record (SHA-256 of the full parse) | 73 / 73 files |
| SW2011 files read; face count equals SolidWorks' | 25 / 25 files, 145 faces |
| Modern files read with no rejected record; face count equals SolidWorks' (2022 set) | 45 / 45 files, 1,414 faces |
| Modern faces with a surface record | 1,414 / 1,414 |
| Surface tag equals SolidWorks' reported type (2022 set without the upgraded C23) | 136 / 136 faces |
| Browser decompressor gives an identical parse to Node's zlib | 73 / 73 |
| Stream CRC-32, inflated size and extra length as stored | 1,730 / 1,730 named streams |
| Strip triangles agreeing with stored normals (original modern parts) | 50,976 / 50,976 |
| Boundary annotations nonzero / interior annotations zero | 41,010 / 41,010 and 71,037 / 71,037 |
| Legacy mesh box equals the dimensions fixed before building ([EXP-066](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump/blob/main/knowledge/evidence/2026-09-22_v0.5-EXP066.md)) | 7 / 7 |
| Legacy mesh box equals the geometry-matched 2022 model's (within 2e-5 m) | 22 / 22 |
| Pre-2011 meshes read; face count equals the native body's ([EXP-077](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump/blob/staging/knowledge/evidence/2026-10-03_v0.5-EXP077.md)) | chainwheel 189 / 189, plate4 14 / 14; SW2000-s01 has no solid and no faces |
| PKWARE implode streams decoded with every input byte consumed | 3 / 3 |

Corruption controls: a flipped CRC bit, a truncated OLE header, truncated OLE sectors, an invalid
sector shift, a cyclic directory chain, a bad zlib Adler-32, truncated zlib data, and an edge table
that disagrees with Block1. Each is rejected or reported.

## STL and STEP export (display mesh)

Against SolidWorks' own exports of the 13 controlled cubes C00–C12:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Emitted STEP has no dangling references | 13 / 13 |
| Exported mesh is closed | 13 / 13 |
| Bounding box equals SolidWorks' STL | 13 / 13, difference 0 |
| STL identical to SolidWorks' | C00, C01, C02, C10 |
| STL a strict superset (SolidWorks' export is missing a face) | C09 |
| Volume, planar models | exact: 1000, 8000, 1000, 995, 424 mm³ |
| Volume, curved models | within 0.09%, which is the difference between the stored mesh and SolidWorks' re-tessellated STL, not decode error |

SolidWorks' STL exports of C03, C09 and C11 have no −X face at all, and C04's has no top cap. The
SLDPRT's own mesh has them. Do not use those STL files as watertight ground truth.

That is the mesh STEP (`--mesh`), which writes planes exactly and everything else as facets. By
default STEP now comes from the Parasolid body instead (next section); the mesh is the fallback.

## Exact STEP export (B-rep)

Against SolidWorks' own `model.step` of all 49 controlled models
([EXP-076](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump/blob/staging/knowledge/evidence/2026-10-03_v0.5-EXP076.md)):

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Our STEP reads back as the native body (EXP-075's comparison, 1e-8 m) | 49 / 49 (first writer: 42 / 49) |
| OpenCascade reads it as one valid solid | 49 / 49 |
| OpenCascade boolean difference with SolidWorks' STEP, both directions | 0 on 49 / 49 |
| Exact volume, ours vs SolidWorks' STEP | worst 5.6e-15 relative |
| Exact volume vs closed form (cubes, shell, chamfer, holes, cone, sphere, torus, half cylinder, crossed cylinders) | 24 files, worst 4.3e-15 relative |
| OpenCascade's volume equals ours to 1e-12 | 47 / 49; both misses are C20, where OpenCascade is the one off the closed form |

On every real part with a solid, where no SolidWorks STEP exists
([EXP-078](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump/blob/staging/knowledge/evidence/2026-10-04_v0.5-EXP078.md)):

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Real parts that export exact STEP | 10 / 10 (SW2000-s01 has no solid) |
| Our STEP reads back as the B-rep model | 10 / 10 |
| OpenCascade reads it as one valid solid | 10 / 10 |
| Intersection curves (401 edges) within 1e-9 m of the true curve | worst 1.0e-9 m |
| Tolerant edges (27) within 1e-9 m of their fin curve | worst 9.9e-10 m |
| Rolling-ball blends (33 faces) within 1e-8 m of the exact surface | worst 2.0e-9 m |
| Swept surfaces (311) written as exact linear extrusions; orientation agrees with the mesh | 311 / 311 |

| part | faces | our volume, mm³ | OpenCascade analytic | OpenCascade triangulated (finest) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| plate4 (Parasolid 9) | 14 | 38400000.000000 | 38400000.000000 | 38400000.000 |
| cube | 6 | 64000.000000 | 64000.000000 | 64000.000 |
| PTC GE8080-8 | 126 | 81662.185970 | 81662.185971 | 81662.819 |
| distributor main boss | 51 | 26264.468529 | 26264.468478 | 26261.892 |
| USB hub BOTTOM | 39 | 6967.866950 | 6967.866980 | 6967.891 |
| USB hub TOP | 68 | 11712.627936 | 11712.631974 | 11712.547 |
| chainwheel (pre-2011) | 189 | 1749586.095642 | 1749586.096126 | 1749569.031 |
| Helical Bevel Gear | 113 | 1309029.949135 | 1309029.987969 | 1309015.443 |
| Pocket Wheel | 400 | 3455354.014618 | 3455354.020517 | 3455364.518 |
| Dekor | 375 | 907356.808841 | 910749.185013 (unstable) | 907356.243 |

OpenCascade's analytic volume agrees with ours to 3e-8 or better everywhere except two parts:
- **Dekor:** the analytic volume jumps between 910749 and 916833 with its tolerance setting, which
  is the routine failing on extrusions. Its own triangulation converges on our number instead.
- **USB hub TOP** (3e-7): its tolerant edges leave the volume defined only to about that.

The triangulated volumes are there as a sanity check; at the deflections used they are only good
to a few parts in 10⁵ on curved parts.

The OpenCascade checks need Python and run in the dump, not in `npm test`.

## Display mesh against the exact surfaces

Every display vertex of the 10 real parts against its own face's exact surface (faces joined by
`link()`: by ID, and by edge set or geometry for chainwheel and plate4):

| | vertices |
|---|---|
| on the surface (within 1e-6 m) | 66,777 |
| off it, on a boundary chord between two on-curve neighbours along the edge | 7,065 |
| off it, on the boundary, not a chord | 11 (USB hub TOP 2, chainwheel 9) |
| off it, in the interior | 231 (Dekor 59, chainwheel 57, Gear 47, USB TOP 38, Pocket Wheel 27, distributor 3) |

EXP-074 left 314 off-surface production vertices unexplained. Checking chords along the B-rep edge
from both faces, at float32 resolution, covers all of the boundary ones in the modern parts.

## Parasolid body

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `.x_t` / `.x_b` exports parsed to the terminator, full byte coverage of binary | 98 / 98 |
| Graph checks on the exports | 28,428, 0 failures |
| Face count equals SolidWorks' | 98 / 98 |
| Text and binary export of the same model differ only in IDs | 49 / 49 pairs |
| Embedded partitions parsed (controlled) | 49 / 49: 8,209 nodes, 287 faces, 14,262 checks, 0 failures |
| Embedded body = SolidWorks' STEP export: every vertex, edge and face, within 1e-8 m (worst 9e-18 m) | 49 / 49 |
| Mutations of 1e-7 m or less, and wrong-model pairings, detected by that comparison | 20 / 20 |
| Embedded body equals the export graph-to-graph ([EXP-072](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump/blob/main/knowledge/evidence/2026-09-29_v0.4.9-EXP072.md)) | 47 / 49 (both lofts differ) |
| Pre-2011 bodies parsed to the terminator, every byte consumed, 0 graph failures | chainwheel (Parasolid 13, 4,279 nodes, 13,527 checks), plate4 (Parasolid 9, 277 nodes, 900 checks) |
| INTERSECTION chart points on both of their surfaces | 392 / 394 curves checkable (2 touch a blend), 2,170 points, worst 3e-15 m |
| Tolerant edges: fin curves hit their stored trim points / the two fin curves within the edge tolerance | 54 / 54 (1e-16 m) and 27 / 27 |
| Original modern parts parsed | 21 / 21: 43,158 nodes, 1,272 faces, 0 failures |
| Native face count equals display face count | 70 / 70 files |
| C00 decoded exactly: corners at 0 and 0.01 m, volume 1e-6 m³, Euler characteristic 2 | both eras |
| Display face ID = native FACE `node_id` | 1,414 / 1,414 |
| Display edge IDs = native edges around the face | 1,408 / 1,408 (+6 empty tables) |
| Display tag = one native surface type | 1,414 / 1,414 |
| Analytic modern faces with every display vertex within 1e-6 m of the native surface | 796 / 1,024 (the rest: boundary chord points, [EXP-074](https://github.com/blussyya/sldprt-research-dump/blob/main/knowledge/evidence/2026-09-29_v0.4.9-EXP074.md)) |

Reader controls: a corrupted fin pointer is caught by the graph checks. Truncation, a trailing
byte, a malformed number and the node limit each stop the reader. Long-form pointer encoding is
exercised synthetically.

## What is not validated

- Real-browser interaction with the viewer. The worker and server are tested, but no browser runs
  in the suite.
- Hostile input in general. The readers are bounded (128 MiB, 2 million vertices, 50,000 faces)
  and strict, but this is not a security audit.
- The 57 interior chainwheel mesh vertices that sit up to 36 µm off every B-rep surface.
- Any file unlike the corpus: other SolidWorks versions, assemblies, drawings, multi-body parts
  with several bodies, sheet metal, weldments.
